Image viewer Activex Control using WTL library

My old experiment building AciveX control for image display and printing.This code is very old (about 10 years) but i' ve recently found it and decided to open source it. 

This code compiles in VS 2013 on Windows 7 X64. 
In order to install built activex control , must run Visual studio as administrator.

Todo :
- implement zoom 
- implement loading other image formats supported by ms windows ( using gdi+ library)
- maybe implement some basic image effects
